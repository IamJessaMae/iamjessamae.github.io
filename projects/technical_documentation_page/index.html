                     <p>Technical documentation in software engineering is the umbrella term that encompasses all written documents and materials dealing with software product development. All software development products, whether created by a small team or a large corporation, require some related documentation. And different types of documents are created through the whole software development lifecycle (SDLC). Documentation exists to explain product functionality, unify project-related information, and allow for discussing all significant questions arising between stakeholders and developers.</p>

                  <p>On top of that, documentation errors can set gaps between the visions of stakeholders and engineers and, as a result, a proposed solution won’t meet stakeholders expectations. Consequently, managers should pay a lot of attention to documentation quality.</p>

                    <p>The documentation types that the team produces and its scope depending on the software development approach that was chosen. There are two main ones: agile and waterfall. Each is unique in terms of accompanying documentation.<br><br>
                 <strong> The Waterfall approach</strong> is a linear method with distinct goals for each development phase. Teams that use waterfall spend a reasonable amount of time on product planning in the early stages of the project. They create an extensive overview of the main goals and objectives and plan what the working process will look like. Waterfall teams strive to create detailed documentation before any of the engineering stages begin. Careful planning works well for projects with little to no changes in progress as it allows for precise budgeting and time estimates. However, waterfall planning has proven to be ineffective for long-term development as it doesn’t account for possible changes and contingencies on the go. According to PMI’s 9th Global Project Management Survey, the Agile approach is used by 71 percent of organizations for their projects.</p>
                   <code> <img width="600"height="300" align-items="center"src="https://www.altexsoft.com/media/2017/12/agile-development-cycle.png"/></code>
                    <p>The agile approach is based on teamwork, close collaboration with customers and stakeholders, flexibility, and ability to quickly respond to changes. The basic building blocks of agile development are iterations; each one of them includes planning, analysis, design, development, and testing. The agile method doesn’t require comprehensive documentation at the beginning. Managers don’t need to plan much in advance because things can change as the project evolves. This allows for just-in-time planning. As one of the Agile Manifesto values suggests, putting – “working software over comprehensive documentation -“, the idea is to produce documentation with information that is essential to move forward, when it makes the most sense.
              <br><br>
              Today, agile is the most common practice in software development, so we’ll focus on documentation practices related to this method.</p>

                     <p>The main goal of effective documentation is to ensure that developers and stakeholders are headed in the same direction to accomplish the objectives of the project. To achieve them, plenty of documentation types exist.<br>
                        Adhering to the following classifications.<br>
                       <code> <img width="500" height="350"src="https://www.altexsoft.com/media/2017/12/word-image-1.png"/></code><br><br>
                        All software documentation can be divided into <strong>two main categories:</strong>
                        <ul>
                          <b> <li>Product documentation</li></b>
                          <b><li>Process documentation</li></b><br>
                      </ul>
                      <strong>Product documentation</strong> describes the product that is being developed and provides instructions on how to perform various tasks with it. In general, product documentation includes requirements, tech specifications, business logic, and manuals. There are two main types of product documentation:
                      <ul>
                        <li>System documentation represents documents that describe the system itself and its parts. It includes requirements documents, design decisions, architecture descriptions, program source code, and FAQs.</li>
                        <li>User documentation covers manuals that are mainly prepared for end-users of the product and system administrators. User documentation includes tutorials, user guides, troubleshooting manuals, installation, and reference manuals.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <strong>Process documentation</strong> represents all documents produced during development and maintenance that describe… well, the process. The common examples of process-related documents are standards, project documentation, such as project plans, test schedules, reports, meeting notes, or even business correspondence.
              <br><br>
              The main difference between process and product documentation is that the first one record the process of development and the second one describes the product that is being developed.

                   <header id="Product_System_documentation"><b>Product System documentation</b></header>
                   <p>System documentation provides an overview of the system and helps engineers and stakeholders understand the underlying technology. It usually consists of the requirements document, architecture design, source code, validation docs, verification and testing info, and a maintenance or help guide. It’s worth emphasizing that this list isn’t exhaustive. So, let’s have a look at the details of the main types.</p>

                <section class="main-section" id="Product_requirement_document">
                  <header id="Product_requirement_document"><b>Product requirement document</b></header>
                  <p>A product requirement document or PRD provides information about system functionality. Generally, requirements are the statements of what a system should do. It contains business rules, user stories, use cases, etc. This document should be clear and shouldn’t be an extensive and solid wall of text. It should contain enough to outline the product’s purpose, its features, functionalities, maintenance, and behavior.
              <br><br>
              The best practice is to write a requirement document using a single, consistent template that all team members adhere to. The one web-page form will help you keep the document concise and save the time spent on accessing the information. Here’s a look at an example of a one-web-page product-requirements document to understand various elements that should be included in your PRD. Nevertheless, you should remember that this isn’t the one and only way to compile this document.</p>

                  <header id="User_Experience_Design_documentation"><b>User Experience Design documentation</b></header>
                 
                    <p>User experience design begins at the requirements stage and proceeds through all the stages of development, including the testing and post-release stages. The process of UX design includes research, prototyping, usability testing, and the actual designing part, during which lots of documentation and deliverables are produced.
              <br><br>
                  The UX documentation can be divided into stages. The research stage includes:
                <ul>
                  <li>User personas</li>
                  <li>User scenario</li>
                  <li>Scenario map</li>
                  <li>User story map</li>
                </ul></p>

                <p>User Personas are created and documented during the research stage. The information gathered during user interviews and surveys is compiled into functional user persona documents. User personas represent the key characteristics of real users, focusing on behavior, thought patterns, and motivation.</p>

                <section class="main-section" id="User_scenario">
                  <header id="User_scenario"><b>User scenario</b></header>
                 
                    <p>A user scenario is a document that describes the steps a user persona will take to accomplish a specific task. User scenarios focus on what a user will do, rather than outlining the thought process. The set of scenarios can be either visual or narrative, and describe the existing scenarios or future functionality.</p>

                  <header id="Scenario_maps">Scenario maps</header>
                  
                     <p>Scenario maps are used to compile the existing user scenarios into a single document. Scenario maps show all possible scenarios available at a given moment. The main purpose of a scenario map is to depict all the possible scenarios for every single function, as well as intersecting scenario steps.

                    <p>The <b>UX style guide</b> is a document that includes the design patterns for the future product. It also describes all possible UI elements and content types used, defining the rules of how they should be arranged and work with each other. But, unlike a UI style guide, UX designers don’t describe the actual look of the interface.
              <br><br>
                  On the stage of <b>prototyping</b> and <b>designing</b>, a UX designer often works with the deliverables and updates documentation on par with other team members, including product owner, UI designers, and development team. The most common documents produced at these stages are:
                <ul>
                  <li>Site maps</li>
                  <li>Wireframes</li>
                  <li>Mock-ups</li>
                  <li>Prototypes</li>
                  <li>User flow schemes or user journey</li>
                  <li>Usability testing reports</li>
                </ul>
                  A site/product map is a visual scheme that represents the connection between all pages of a product. The map helps the whole team visualize the structure of a website or app and the connections between the pages/functions. Creating a site map is a part of arranging the information architecture.<br>
